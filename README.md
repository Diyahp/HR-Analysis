**HR Analysis with Power bi**
This repository contains the code and resources used for an HR Analysis project completed using Power Bi

   **Project Overview**
**Problems HR Data aimed to solve:**
1.	Utilise ‘Dashboard Data’ to develop a dashboard for the HR director and SMT which presents a summary of how Dover Insurance is performing against key metrics.
2.	Demonstrate how the dashboard works by identifying key findings including a critical assessment of the following areas:
a.	How inclusive the flexible working and career development opportunities are at Dover Insurance; 
b.	The scale and extent of any absence problems at Dover Insurance;
c.	Any patterns in time spent viewing non-work content online; and
d.	Usage of the wellness app.
3.	What 3 specific actions would you advise the HR Director and SMT to prioritise in the next 12-18 months based on your analysis? Justify your proposals.

**Also using the Regression Data**

1.	Run a correlation analysis to identify potential drivers of ‘overall wellbeing’. 
2.	Perform regression analyses to identify key drivers of ‘overall wellbeing’ and explain what the model tells you in terms of boosting employee wellbeing. 
3.	Critically evaluate the limitations of the regression analysis. What additional sources of data might you want to consider for deeper insights into wellbeing at Dover Insurance?
